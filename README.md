# World Bank Climate Dashboard

[Dashboard link](https://worldbank-climate-dashboard.herokuapp.com)

Please note: The app is running on free dynos via Heroku which get activated when you visit. Thus, you might face a timeout once or twice but hopefully the first refresh should work.

Instructions on navigating the dashboard:

1. The world map displays variation in national average temperature using a color scale. 
2. Each country has a diamond marker at its centre; data for that country can be accessed by clicking that marker.
3. The top plot in the right column of the dashboard will always display the yearly average temperature of the selected country.
4. The bottom plot can be selected by using the dropdown menu; it contains several economic/social indicators from the World Bank's Indicators API.
5. Use the bar to the right of the plots for toggling options such as hover, tap, zoom in and out etc.
